<h1>To Do List Project</h1>

This project is related to the To-Do-List assignment on The Odin Project.

The assignment is linked here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list

My inspiration for my to-do-list app was the TickTick UI where:
- On the left, there are categories of to-do-list items
- In the middle, there are the to-do-list items within a specific category
- On the right, there are details for each to-do-list item such as name, description, due date, and priority

The application does function and store the to-do-list items within your sesion. You are able to create multiple categories, to-do-list items, and edit the details within each item.

<h2>Future Improvments:</h2>

- The UI needs an overhaul to look pretty and be responsive
- Local storage so you don't lose session data
- Time and Date display is not human friendly once chosen
- Priority dropdown requires user to remove the entry to see all options when editing to-do-list items
